# Add Collateral Assets

## Introduction

Finablr enables users to register multiple collateral assets to their account listings. This documentation will guide you through the process of adding, managing, and understanding the importance of collateral assets within the Finablr ecosystem. Remember, registering collateral does not transfer ownership to Finablr; it simply helps in evaluating and securing your loan applications.

#### Before you proceed, take note of the following:
1. Take photos of your collateral asset.
2. Prepare valuation details, including the purchase price of the collateral.

1. **Go to [Add Collateral Asset](https://finablr.app/app/assets/create) and select a category.**
